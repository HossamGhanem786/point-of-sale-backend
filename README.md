     Online banking you can pay your bills,
    transfer money, and access a record of your checking account transactions,
    all from your web browser.

    Banking from the comfort of your sofa makes everything you
    do with your finances a bit easier. More and more banks allow you
    to deposit checks by simply taking a picture of the check with
    your phone. You can access your banking information anywhere
    that you have access to the Internet, on your computer or mobile device.

    You may decide to switch your accounts to an online-only bank
    in the future. These banks offer most of the same advantages online
    as a traditional bank, but online-only banks have no physical branch
    locations. While this might seem like an issue, online-only banks offer
    a few benefits that might make it worth the trade-off.
